# WebSink
A basic implementation of a browser Sinkhole, with network traffic interception.
Uses external third-party Open-Source libraries:
- [OkHttp Client](square.github.io/okhttp) for controlling web requests externally
- [Chucker library](github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker) for traffic interception
