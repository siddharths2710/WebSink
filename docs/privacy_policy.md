# Privacy Policy

WebSink is maintained as an open-source project, which allows for anyone to access the source code for making decisions or contributing out of one's own will.

## No ads
The app currently does not leverage any mobile advertising platform and have a monetization pipeline of any sort. 

## No microtransactions
Apart from the one-time app store fee, the app is free from any IAP based promotional incentives.

## No Analytics
The app does not gather any metrics or feedback for the time being, but this is subject to change as part of ongoing development.

## Permissions

WebSink requests couple of permissions to provide full functionality:
 - File access is requested for reading SSL certificates inherently chosen for the Pinning process
 - Internet is the main requirement for surfing the web in the sandbox, plus for offering traffic inspection
